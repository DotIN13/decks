 * screen — the browser composites one layer instead of re-laying-out twelve.
 *
 * Gestures follow the trackpad, because that is what this is used on: two-finger
 * scroll pans, pinch zooms, and a plain wheel zooms only when a modifier says so.
 * Space or middle-button drag pans from anywhere, including across a board.
 *
 * **And they follow a hand, because a phone has no trackpad either.** A touchscreen
 * sends no wheel events at all, so every one of those gestures was missing: pinching
 * the canvas moved it about instead of zooming it, since two fingers were two
 * independent one-finger pans. Two fingers are now one gesture (`touch.ts` reduces
 * them, `pinchCamera` moves the camera) and one finger pans — the rule being that a
 * finger on the canvas moves the canvas unless it landed on something that says
 * otherwise, which on a board means a title bar or a component already selected.
